Kaju katli (literally "cashew slice"), also known as kaju barfi, is an Indian dessert similar to a barfi. Kaju means cashew; Barfi is often, but not always, made by thickening milk with sugar and other ingredients (such as dry fruits and mild spices). Kesar kaju katli is a kaju katli recipe that includes saffron.

The dish is prepared with cashew nuts soaked in water for a considerable period of time (usually overnight), which are then ground to a paste. Sugar solution is boiled down until a single thread forms when two fingers are dipped into it and pulled apart, after which it is added to the ground cashews kaju. Ghee, saffron (kesar), and dried fruits may also be added. The paste is then spread and flattened in a shallow, flat-bottomed dish and cut into bite-sized diamond-shaped pieces. The pieces are usually decorated with edible silver foil. The finished sweet is usually white or yellow in color depending on the ingredients used for the paste and the proportions of each used. Katli is traditionally eaten during Diwali.

Kaju katli can also be prepared by replacing the sugar syrup with crystallised sugar and heating the entire dough instead of the sugar-water syrup. Kaju katli is not a long lasting dessert, in winter it can last up to 7 days, but in summer one should consume it within 3-4 days. Due to its popularity in India, many vendors such as Bikaner and SweetDabba have made a sugar free version of this sweet.
